Hello, and thanks for downloading this game! As you probably already guessed, this game is enirely fictional, including characters,
story plot, locations, and names. Any resemblace to a figure or place is purely coincidental All of the music you hear is made by me,
using Beepbox.co and all audio samples and sound effects were made by me or used from a copyright-free site. 

- How to Play -

The game has you pick out an option out of 2 or 3 that are provided to you. To minimize spelling errors and reduce the time it takes to
code everything, I have chosen to opt for a number system. Essencially, all you need to do is enter in 1, 2, or 3 depending on the choice
that you want to make. The options are also listed just in case you forget what you want to choose. Here's an example: (This is not in the game)

You're stranded on a massive island. What do you decide to do?

1. Forage for food
2. Gather materials (wood, stones, etc.)
3. Look for survivors

If I wanted to gather materials, I would type in "2", and hit enter. The game would then choose that path and show the dialogue until the next
option appears. It's a pretty simple system, and there isn't much to get used to as it'll only really take a couple turns.

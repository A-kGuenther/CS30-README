The Forgotton Quest: A text-based choose your own adventure story

Creator's Note: The game will most likely be incomplete by the due date, although you should expect at least half of the main game finished, or a couple of available 
paths for game completion. If you want, I will be more than glad to update you on the progress made, and send you the full game once it is completed if you would like
to try it out. Thanks.


- How to Play -

Now, like most other text-based games, they have you type out the action and the game moves along with the script. However, some extremely common errors that I've
noticed that use this format, is the constant errors and incorrect choice dialogue when trying to enter something in. This can be due to something being capitalized
(or not), a singular misspelled word, due to language differences or way of typing, or whatever it may be. It can be frustrating and ruins the fun and immersion of the
game. What I've decided to do is make my own system for choosing a path by using a numbering system. For example, you would be given a list of choices that you can
choose from, and will have numbers beside them. To select an option, all you need to do is type in the number that the choice is affiliated with. It makes selecting
an option much easier, and reduces the amount of errors given out from the smallest reasons to essencially, an absolute minimum. The entire game is built around that
concept, and if I were to guess, would hopefully take about 1-3 hours of gameplay in its finished form.


- Game Information & Copyright -

This game is entirely copyright free, as all the music and sound effects that you hear for the game are made purely by me. Any similar-sounding effects or music, is
entirely coincidental and is not meant to be a reference unless otherwise stated. The Forgotton Quests is a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure text-based game that Ayden Guenther
is working on solo, and was made by inspiration to make a quest game inside of another game, Rec Room. Simply put, the game originated from there, and is being worked on
along with the text-based version, available for download on Windows, Mac, and Linux computers. The game is currently not yet compatible with any mobile phones, such as
Android or iPhone, and will be worked on upon game completion.

This game is based on a quest from Rec Room (link below), of Curse of the Crimson Cauldron, and is meant to be a more run-down, medieval-style quest, where 4 heros
(originally), have been summoned by an ancient wizard, in order to stop the corruption that has taken control of the Witch Tower, and save the witch herself. 300 years
later, the (post-)evil witch, settled down after being previously defeated by the royal kingsmen, and now resides in her tower, watching over the land and protecting
those who live within. Isadore Thornheart as we now call her, has been taken over by a mysterious known corruption that spread from the depths below, turning everything
it touches into a dangerous, feiry material. Xileus, the ancient wizard, looking over what his lands have become and of his wife, summons 4 new heros who are worthy; the
last hope for the kingdom, and restore peace to the realm. Because all great stories.. begin with a call for help.
